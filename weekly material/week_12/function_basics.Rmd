## Function Basics

### What is a function?
+ Backbone of R programming language, majority of things you will do in R rely on them!
+ Set of statements that performs a specific task
+ User is able to call or pass information to the function
+ Function will perform task and return object or value or action

### Where do functions come from?
+ Many built into base R
+ Many many more available through different package libraries
+ Can create your own! (This will be covered later in the semester)

### How are functions structured on the back-end?

### How are functions called (or used)?

Some functions don't require any arguments, or have default values that don't need to be changed.
  
  **function_name()**

Some will require argument values to be specified. These will both print results straight to the console.

  **function_name(arg_1= x, arg_2 = y)**
  
  **function_name(x, y)**
  
The returned value can also be assigned to a new object

  **new_object <- function_name(arg_1= x, arg_2 = y)**
  
### Example - creating a simple function:

```{r example_1}
add_together <- function(value1 = 1, value2 = 1){
  value1 + value2
}

add_together()

add_together(value1 = 200, value2 = 34)

add_together(200,34)

add_together(value1 = 200)

```

### Example - using a function in base R:
Use seq() to generate a numeric sequence from 1 to 20
```{r example_2}
seq(from=1, to=20, by=1)

seq(from=1, to=20, by=2)

seq(from=1, to=20, length.out=10)

a <- 2
b <- 40

new_seq <- seq(from=a,to=b,by=6)
new_seq
 
```

### Resources for learning about specific functions
 + Built in RStudio help
    + Help pane
    + typing ?_keyword_ into the console
 + Google/online resources
    + [rdocumentation.org](https://rdocumentation.org /packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/seq)
 + Functions from package libraries
    + Example: read_delim from readr package
    + [Package documentation](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html)
    + [rdocumentation.org](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.3.1/topics/read_delim)
