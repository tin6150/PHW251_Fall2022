## Working with dates in R

Most software/programming languages store dates behind the scenes as numbers but display to the user as formats we're used to. Like Microsoft (1/1/1900) and SAS (1/1/1960), R anchors to a specific date (1/1/1970). Dates are stored as the number of days before or after 1/1/1970 and date/times are stored as the number of seconds before or after 1/1/1970.


```{r include=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```

```{r dates, echo=TRUE}


# Default format is yyyy-mm-dd - if you use that format, you don't have to specify
# You can assign a date to an object by using a date conversion function and passing a character date string
# Using base SAS function as.Date()

dob <- as.Date("2020-09-03")
dob


sn50bday = as.Date("1970-01-01")
sn50bday %>% as.integer()

# Derive the number of days since 1/1/1970 by converting the date object to numeric
as.numeric(dob)
#Confirming a different way
as.numeric(dob) - as.numeric(as.Date("1970-01-01")) 

# if you wanted to add 90 days to a date (or a column of dates):
as.Date("2020-09-04") + 90

# Converting strings to date or date/time

# If it's in a different format, you just have to include a format

chr_dates <- c("03/05/1985", "09/21/1972")
dates <- as.Date(chr_dates, "%m/%d/%Y")
dates

sn51dob = as.Date( "12/25/1969", "%m/%d/%Y" )
as.integer(sn51dob)

# Another frequently used function is getting the current date
Sys.Date()

# This is actually an argumentless function, but you still have to include the parens or it will return the code for the function
Sys.Date

# Using lubridate package functions (part of the tidyverse)

# Lubridate makes things a little easier in working with dates

dob <- as_date("2020-09-03")
dob

# Using the mdy function easily converts the US date convention (or many other date conventions) to R date
mdy("02/29/2020")

# if you wanted to add 90 days to a date (or a column of dates) it's basically the same:
as.Date("2020-09-04") + 90

# But if you need to add three months, lubridate makes it much easier
as_date("2020-09-04") + months(1)

# that works fine, but becomes a little problematic if the added month has fewer days
as_date("2020-03-31") + months(1)

# the %m+% operator adds a month but reverts back to the last day of the month if the expression yields a non-existent date
as_date("2020-03-31") %m+% months(1)


sn50dob = as.Date( "1/1/1970", "%m/%d/%Y" )
sn50dob + months(1) + 30 + years(1)

typeof(sn50dob)

# On the off chance you need to convert from numeric:

lubridate::as_date(18239)



# You can also get current time (just have to be careful about time zone) using

with_tz(Sys.time(), tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")

```

It makes sense to keep dates as numeric behind the scene, since you'll often want to be able to compare dates, identify number of days, weeks, months, and years between dates, and see if something happened early or later.

```{r}
# Difference in days
Sys.Date() - as.Date("2020-09-03")

# which date is earlier, later etc
Sys.Date() < as.Date("2020-09-03")

# another method of determining days between two dates, but also the option for other measures
as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), as.Date("2020-09-03"), units = "days"))
as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), as.Date("2020-09-03"), units = "hours"))

# If you need to extract a date part out of a date object:
test <- as_date("1999-04-02")
day(test)
month(test)
year(test)

typeof(month(test))
typeof(year(test))


# day of the week
wday(test, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)

# day of the year (julian day)
yday(test)

# key time measure for public health built into lubridate!
epiweek(test)

```

You can also sort and join (next week) a dataset by dates more efficiently because it has numeric properties.  As well as querying the most recent even in a dataset, grouped by people.

When you import dataset, most packages will make an attempt to guess that a column contains a date and automatically convert. But for the sake of learning how to manually manipulate, we'll use base R import

```{r}
cdcr_nodt <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data/master/cdcr-prison-totals.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# note: readr::read_csv will guess the column data types, so you wouldn't need to convert if you used read_csv.
str(cdcr_nodt)
# In a dataset with dates as character, convert to date 

cdcr_nodt$date_mod <- ymd(cdcr_nodt$date) #as_date would also work

# Getting the most recent date and earliest date
max(cdcr_nodt$date_mod)
min(cdcr_nodt$date_mod)

# and epi week

cdcr_nodt$epiwk <- epiweek(cdcr_nodt$date_mod)

xtabs(~epiwk, cdcr_nodt)

```
