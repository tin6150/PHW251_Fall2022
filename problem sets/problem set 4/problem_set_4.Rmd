For this problem set you will tidy up a dataset of 500 individuals. We also want to calculate each individual's BMI and appropriately categorize them.

Load your data (500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight.csv):

```{r load, include=FALSE}

```

### Question 1

Clean the column headers to be all lower case, have no spaces, and rename "Location information" to location.

```{r clean}

```

\newpage 

### Question 2

Create a new variable that calculates BMI for each individual.

You will need to navigate the different system of measurements (metric vs imperial). Only the United States is using imperial.

* BMI calculation and conversions:
    - metric:   $BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]^2$
    - imperial: $BMI = 703 * weight (lbs) / [height (in)]^2$
    - 1 foot = 12 inches
    - 1 cm = 0.01 meter

Although there's many ways you can accomplish this task, we want you to use an if_else() to calculate BMI with the appropriate formula based on each person's location. 

```{r bmi_calc}

```

\newpage

### Question 3

Create a new variable that categorizes BMI with case_when():

* Underweight: BMI below 18.5
* Normal: 18.5-24.9
* Overweight: 25.0-29.9
* Obese: 30.0 and Above

```{r bmi_cat}

```

Could we have used if_else()?

### Question 4

Arrange your data first by location and then by descending order of BMI.

```{r arrange_ds}

```

### Question 5

Use a dplyr method to remove the height, weight, and BMI columns from your data.

```{r remove_cols}

```

\newpage

### Optional Challenge

Perform all the actions in this problem set with one dpylr call. 

```{r mega_call}

```
